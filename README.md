# Croquet (PHS4700)

This is an old school project focused on implementing the physics in a game of
croquet. I went a little overboard and implemented everything from scratch in
C++ so figure it might be worth keeping.

## Running

From the `src` folder:

```
make -j4
```

and then from the `bin` folder:

```
./phs4700-crocket
```
